**Additional features:**
You can change the color of the theme by replacing files in main theme folder from `/colors/~color name~/ folder`.      
Also you can remove additional line in calendar by renaming `upper_screen.bmp` into `upper_screen_cal6.bmp` and `upper_screen_cal5.bmp` into `upper_screen.bmp`. If month needs more lines then rename files backwards.
